    "# _Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II_ \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is an in-depth investigation of the [Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II](https://leetcode.com/explore/interview/card/top-interview-questions-easy/92/array/564/) question on Leetcode. Below is the description of the problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "_Say you have an array `prices` for which the $i$th element is the price of a given stock on day $i$. Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times._\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, here is an example of an input, and what should be the output with an explanation.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]\n",
    "Output: 7\n",
    "Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4. Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So the example above works using the valley/peak concept. essentially works on the concept of comparing the current day's price with yesterday's price, and if the yesterday's price is higher than today's price, it'll buy the stock. But if yesterday's price is lower , this particular algorithm will buy the stock. If It continues to do this for each day input. "

We will then update it by the difference in tomorrow's price and today's price. Because a variable is constant space, the space complexity is $O(1)$ (i.e., will always execute in the same space)."
