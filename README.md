# Techincal Study and Review

The following repository contains notebooks outlining how to solve various technical questions that may come up in a software engineering interview. All questions will be answered in Jupyter notebook format, and will include the following:

- restatement of the problem and any assumptions about the environment
- code of solution
- line-by-line interpretation of the solution
- an analysis of time and space complexity of the algorithm

This repository is still in its early stages, but I hope that it'll grow to include a robust set of problems that can be utilized to study for technical interviews.
